# Security Updates and Best Practices for Onchain Monitor

This document outlines small, incremental changes to tighten security in the Onchain Monitor project.

Recommended practices implemented in this patch set:

- Minimize privileged access exposure by centralizing access control on sensitive operations.
- Add non-invasive tooling to verify ownership without changing existing contract state.
- Improve maintainability with a small deployment sanity script.

Notes:
- Do not deploy any changes to production without running the existing test suite and a focused security review.
- This document intentionally refrains from changing business logic; it provides guidance and ancillary tooling to support secure development.

Upgrade path:
- If future changes introduce new owner-only interfaces, follow the pattern demonstrated by scripts/showOwner.ts to verify permissions during development.
